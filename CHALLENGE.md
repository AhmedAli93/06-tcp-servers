===

## Requirements
Create a function that will accept an array as it's input. Your function should find all numbers dissappeared from that array, with a starting integer of `1` and an ending integer of the highest value in the array.

For example, given an array of integers `[1, 2, 4, 5]`, your function should return `3`.

Here's another example - given an array of `[4, 3, 2, 7, 8, 2, 3]`, your function should return `[1, 5, 6]`.

## Submission Instructions

1. With your assigned partner, pseudocode your solution on the whiteboard. Take a picture of your proposed solution for your repo.
1. Make a new branch and folder in your whiteboard challenge repository on GitHub. The name of the folder should be the same as the name of the challenge.
1. This folder should contain:
	- A file named `solution.js` which contains the JavaScript solution
	- A picture of your pseudocoded solution from the whiteboarding exercise
	- A `README.md` which includes the problem domain
1. Complete the whiteboard challenge in your text editor, and verify that it's functional.
1. Make a pull request from your working branch to your master branch.
1. Submit a link to your PR on Canvas *or* submit a link to your `repo/daily-whiteboarding-directory/solution.js`

## Stretch Goal

1. Included with your `solution.js`, create a `__test__` directory and associated `solution.test.js` file, that contains a series of tests for your solution.  You may write as many tests (and assertions) as you'd like.
